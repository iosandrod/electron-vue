Title: Undercurrent

Even if the sky is deep and no cracks are visible  就算天空再深，看不出裂痕
My brows still furrow with heavy clouds  眉头仍聚满密云
Even if a dark room can't illuminate my body
It can still reflect your heart
Let this cigarette  rise  as my body sinks
I used to want, oh how I wanted, to get closer
To your heart, your eyes, your lips, and your ears, all out of reach
I can't grasp them tightly
Afraid of tragedy replaying in my fate, my fate
The more beautiful something is, the less I can touch it
History repeats itself in this noisy city
There's no reason to love without undercurrents 没理由相恋可以没有暗涌
In reality, cherishing you again, what's the use? 其实我再去爱惜你又有何用
Could it be this time I embrace you without falling short? 难道这次我抱紧你未必落空
I still wait for you to tell me not to misuse my god 仍静候着你说我别错用神
I have a premonition of everything 什么我都有预感
Then I can't open my eyes to see fate  
And then the sky is filled with heavy clouds again
Even if the sky is deep and no cracks are visible
My brows still furrow with heavy clouds
Even if a dark room can't illuminate my body
It can still reflect your heart
Let this cigarette rise as my body sinks
I used to want, oh how I wanted, to get closer
To your heart, your eyes, your lips, and your ears, all out of reach
I can't grasp them tightly
Afraid of tragedy replaying in my fate, my fate
The more beautiful something is, the less I can touch it
History repeats itself in this noisy city
There's no reason to love without undercurrents
In reality, cherishing you again, what's the use?
Could it be this time I embrace you without falling short?
I still wait for you to tell me not to misuse my god
I have a premonition of everything
Then I can't open my eyes to see fate approaching
And then the sky is filled with heavy clouds again
Still waiting for you to tell me not to misuse my god
I have a premonition of everything
Then I can't open my eyes to see fate approaching
And then the sky is filled with heavy clouds again
And then the sky is filled with heavy clouds again
